# Image-Noising-Denoising
A fresh greyscale photo was taken. 
Firstly I added different kind of noise to it, using the random_noise(from skimage), like poisson noise, gaussian noise, s&p noise etc.
Then I denoised the images of different noise types with different kernels, comparing the results with the original image.

Libraries used - cv2, numpy, skimage, matplotlib
